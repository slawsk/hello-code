This is the code for the wall display HELLO CODE

- Initially, convert CodeDictionary.txt from XML to a list of text strings, using
```convert-dict.py```. If you want the code to be up to date, you can rerun this
once a year.

- The list of text strings is ```irc_text_list.json```

- ```pull-random.py``` loads up the json file with the list just once, when the program is first run, and then picks a random section
